A card game where the player attempts to beat the dealer by getting closer to 21 without going over.

To create this I used a mix of JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

To instigate the game, click play and enter your name. 
Following this, select "Deal" to draw your cards.
You will be drawn 2 cards and the dealer just 1. 
If you wish to draw further cards, click "hit" until you're ready to "stay".

Once you "Stay", the dealer will try and beat your score without going over 21.

If you win, your bet will be returned double.
If you tie, your bet will be returned.
If you lose, the house keeps your bet.
If at any point you wish to stop playing, click "leave table".

Should you reach $0, you will be asked to leave the table, with a chance to buy back in.
