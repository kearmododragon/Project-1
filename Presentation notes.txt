showing code
favourite function setPlayer(or dlr)HandValue

potentially looks complicated
splits the cards from "5Diamond" to "5" "D" "I" etc.
checks to see if 0 in the array is a number, and awards those points.
checks if it's T(ten) J(Jack) Q(Queen) K(King) and awards 10.
T rather than 10
then checks for A to give 11. 

The more work I did on this the easier I found it.
Ended up writing psuedo code/plan on a sheet of paper
helped really picture what was doing.

simple bits like "if card is 1-9 give points"
If letter not A give 10
if A give 11/1

To start with though I spent a few days really regretting
my choice of blackjack as I was lost, felt like 
I was just in the middle of a desert with no clue where to go.

I think to improve this, I would have liked better CSS,
cards in your hand to show and A to be 11/1, however
i'm happy with where it's at.
